**Which money laundering typology involves the most bank accounts, and what does this suggest about the complexity of these schemes?**

<br>

<img width="799" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02 14 46" src="https://github.com/yachu1005/Big-Data-Solutions-for-Combating-Financial-Fraud/assets/145074370/3d10a9fd-5461-4d4b-9fd6-407d86187b1e">

<br>

Answer: The bar chart demonstrates that the "Scatter-Gather" and "Gather-Scatter" typologies involve the most distinct bank accounts compared to other types. This suggests that these methods of money laundering are more complex and possibly more organized, as they involve the distribution and collection of funds across many accounts. The complexity of these schemes may make them harder to detect and could indicate a more widespread network of collusion. It is important for financial institutions to pay special attention to these patterns in transactions to effectively combat money laundering.

<br><br>

**What does the variation in cycle duration reveal about different money laundering typologies?**

<br>
 
<img width="803" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02 15 38" src="https://github.com/yachu1005/Big-Data-Solutions-for-Combating-Financial-Fraud/assets/145074370/368b6379-7f44-430d-8370-6c6c1cf5af5a">

 <br>
 
Answer: The graph presents the average, minimum, and maximum duration of money laundering cycles for various typologies. The "Gather-Scatter" typology shows a significant variation, with cycle durations ranging from a few days to over two months, suggesting highly irregular patterns. This variability could indicate the use of sophisticated techniques designed to evade detection. In contrast, typologies like "Fan-in" and "Fan-out" display shorter and more consistent cycle durations, potentially reflecting simpler or more straightforward methods. The broad range in cycle durations for certain typologies underlines the need for dynamic monitoring systems that can adapt to the diverse timings of these illicit activities.

<br><br>

**How do different money laundering typologies distribute across various transaction amount ranges?**

<br>

<img width="803" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02 16 25" src="https://github.com/yachu1005/Big-Data-Solutions-for-Combating-Financial-Fraud/assets/145074370/ecfe2b40-8757-4fd0-85be-c80cc68bde9f">

<br>

Answer: The chart demonstrates a prevalence of smaller transactions within the ' 0âˆ’
 3000' range across various laundering methods, likely a strategy to evade detection by staying under the radar of regulatory thresholds. Typically, as the transaction value increases, the occurrence of transactions tends to decrease due to heightened visibility and risk. However, there is a notable increase in transactions within the '$21001+' bracket, implying that for substantial sums, launderers may opt for significantly higher amounts, possibly to optimize the laundering process or to accommodate the volume of illicit funds. This spike at high transaction levels, especially in "Scatter-Gather" and "Stack" methods, suggests a preference for these typologies when handling large amounts of money. The data underscores the importance of thorough monitoring across all transaction levels, tailored to the nuances of different laundering techniques.

<br><br>

**What is the distribution of Cross-Currency Transaction among the Money Laundering transaction?**

<br>

<img width="804" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02 17 31" src="https://github.com/yachu1005/Big-Data-Solutions-for-Combating-Financial-Fraud/assets/145074370/97118ca8-c5dc-4c92-a426-cc78e1669ed7">

<br>

Answer: Based on the graph, we can see that the most common cross-currency transaction in the transactions is Euro-US Dollar, followed by Yen-US Dollar, Euro-Yuan, US Dollar-Yen, and other currency pairs. Of these cross-currency transactions, the most prevalent money laundering method is STACK. This could be because STACK money laundering type typically involves multiple layers of transactions to further obscure the source of funds and changing currencies will adds another layer of complexity for the stack to the laundering process, making it harder to follow the money trail.

<br><br>

## **Future Improvement**

For future improvement in the detection and analysis of money laundering, integrating additional data sources could provide significant benefits. Incorporating diverse data such as real-time transaction feeds, geographic information, and external watchlists could enrich the analysis, allowing for the identification of nuanced patterns and correlations not visible through transaction data alone. Furthermore, experimenting with advanced machine learning models, including ensemble methods, deep learning networks, or anomaly detection systems, could enhance detection rates and reduce false positives. Expanding the temporal analysis to cover longer periods and conducting comparative year-over-year reviews might also yield insights into long-term trends and help predict future laundering activities based on past patterns. Moreover, developing a collaborative framework where multiple financial institutions can share insights and data, while respecting privacy norms, would lead to a more comprehensive view of money laundering tactics. Lastly, continuously updating analysis techniques to align with new regulatory requirements and emerging financial instruments, like cryptocurrencies, can help stay ahead of launderers who adapt quickly to the changing financial landscape.

<br><br>
